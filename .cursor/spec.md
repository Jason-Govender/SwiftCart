Online Shopping Backend System – Console
Application (C#) Specification
This document defines the specification for the Online Shopping Backend System, implemented
as a C# Console Application. The project simulates the backend logic of a real encommerce
platform where customers can browse products, manage shopping carts, place orders, and process
payments, while administrators manage products, inventory, and orders. The system is designed to
demonstrate strong use of objectnoriented programming, backend logic design, LINQ querying,
error handling, and clean architecture within a consolenbased environment. Two submissions are
required for this project. Submission 1 Due: 9 March 2026 – 12:00 PM
Submission 2 Due: 9 March 2026 – 5:00 PM

1. System Overview
   The application represents the backend operations of an online shopping platform. Users interact
   with the system through a structured console interface that allows them to perform operations such
   as browsing products, managing carts, placing orders, and generating reports. The system
   supports two main roles: Customer – shops for products and places orders Administrator –
   manages the platform inventory and orders

2. Core Functional Requirements
   User registration and login
   Customer and Administrator role separation
   Product catalog management
   Shopping cart functionality
   Order placement and tracking
   Payment simulation through wallet balance
   Inventory management and stock tracking
   Administrative reporting and analytics
   Product review and rating system
   Exception handling and input validation
3. Console Interaction
   The system must provide a menundriven console interface that allows users to navigate through
   the application and perform operations using numbered menu selections.

The system must demonstrate strong backend development practices in C#. The implementation
should include: Objectnoriented design principles Class inheritance and polymorphism Interfaces
for key system behaviors LINQ for querying data collections Exception handling for system stability
Use of collections such as List to store system data

6. Project Submissions
   Submission 1 focuses on implementing the core backend functionality of the system. Submission
   2 expands the system by incorporating software Design Patterns and improving architecture and
   maintainability of the codebase.
